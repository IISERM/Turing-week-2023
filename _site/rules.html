<h1 id="specific-rules-and-guidelines-for-the-hackathon">Specific Rules and Guidelines for the Hackathon.</h1>

<p> 
No coding (just pseudo code)
</p>
<p>

- The answers will be checked based on the involvement of following conditions:
    - Overly complex logic.
    - Long and convoluted functions.
    - Long execution time.
2. Marks will be deducted in case we found your code have unnecessary loops, variables and conditions. 

3. 

</p>

<h1 id="for-those-who-love-us-and-will-code">For those who love us and will code:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You may use any language of your choice. You may also use different languages for different questions. But you should know that questions were made with Python in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You may <strong>not</strong> use any packages not listed below. In case you feel that another library is absolutely necessary, bring it to our attention. Decision will be final and binding. Basically, only math related packages, plotting packages, String related packages and of-course standard libraries are allowed. The point of the Hackathon is to evaluate on the basis of logic, not on how well you can look it up on the internet.
    - Python - Numpy(only for simple array manipulation), Matplotlib and Pandas
    - Julia - Plots (any prefered backend, but GR is best) and DataFrames
    - C++ - gnuplot-iostream.h, time.h, fstream
    - Java - jfreechart or equivalent, File
A particular question might allow usage of a specific library. If so, it would be mentioned in the question. If you feel the need to use an unmentioned library, inform the organizers.</li>
  <li>You may use any IDE/environment of your choice. Personal preference of the organizers are Jupyter for Python, Pluto for Julia.</li>
  <li>You are free to ask the organizers any questions you want. Even questions like <em>how to read from a file in Python?</em> are welcome. You may not get all the answers you want though. ðŸ™‚ Again, the point is to solve the problem.</li>
</ol>
