## Problem 1: Worst Sorting Algorithm ever!!
Imagine yourself a nerd studying in Indian institute of Programming and Coding (IIPC). And you got your first internship in Microogle under Sundar Nadela and was asked to implement your favourite sorting algorithm. But since you are first year student, you are deemed to write a fuzzy and complex logical code whose execution time is damn high. 
<hr color="black">

### Define a function that take the list and return the sorted list (ascending order).

### Note: There is euqals weightage for execution time and complex logic used. (So, just don't google the worst sorting algorithm).

## Problem 2: Proper Substrings!
Write a Python program to check if the ${(n-1)}^{th}$ string is a proper substring of $n^{th}$ in a given list of strings and first string in the list would be "IISERM".

## Problem 3: Prime Factors!
Write a algorithm to obtain the list of prime factors of any input number taken from the user.

Input: `420`

Output: `[2,2,3,3,7]`

## Problem 5: Matrix Multiplication!!

Matrix multiplication can be expensive. 

## Bonus Question: You need to code this! ;)

## The Dirac Delta Function

The Dirac delta function, denoted by $\delta(x)$, is a mathematical function that is defined as:

$$
\delta(x) = \begin{cases} 
      \infty, & x = 0 \\
      0, & \text{otherwise} 
   \end{cases}
$$

Despite this definition, the Dirac delta function is not actually a function in the usual sense, as it is not well-defined at $x = 0$. Instead, it is a distribution, or generalized function, that is used to model certain physical phenomena.


$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\delta(x-a)dx = f(a)
$$

where $f(x)$ is a well-behaved function, and $a$ is a constant.


#### Your Job is to remember the theme of this hackathon and then, numerically integrate the above equation for the $ f(x) = 2x^2 + sin(x)$ and the value of a is $\pi$.
